//  Write a Circle class that has the following member variables:
//
//  * radius - a double
//  * pi - a double initialized with the value 3.14159
//
//  The class should also have the following member functions:
//
//  * Default Constructor - a default constructor that sets radius to 0.0
//  * Constructor - accepts the radius of the circle as an argument
//  * setRadius - a mutator function for the radius variable
//  * getRadius - an accessor function for the radius variable
//  * getArea - returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as
//      area = pi * radius * radius
//  * getDiameter - returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as
//      diameter = radius * 2
//  * getCircumference - returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as
//      circumference = 2 * pi * radius
//
//  Write a program that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the
//  circle's radius, creating a Circle object, then reporting the circle's area, diameter, and
//  circumference.
